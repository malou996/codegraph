# Dispatch-Synthesizer Backlog — the "dispatch-through-indirection" family

**Audience:** a Claude agent continuing the coverage mission.
**Relationship to the playbook:** this is a *cross-cutting* companion to
[`dynamic-dispatch-coverage-playbook.md`](./dynamic-dispatch-coverage-playbook.md).
The playbook's §6 matrix is organized by **language × framework**. This doc is
organized by **dispatch *shape*** — because a single framework can contain several
distinct indirection shapes (Redux alone is ≥2: hand-written thunks vs RTK Query),
and several shapes recur identically across many frameworks/languages (a name→class
registry is the same problem in trezor `connect`, n8n nodes, and a VS Code command
palette). Redux-thunk (`synthesizedBy:'redux-thunk'`) was the first member shipped;
this is the queue behind it.

Status legend (matches the playbook): ✅ done+validated · 🟡 shipped but under-validated
· 🔬 hole identified · ⬜ not started · ⛔ deliberately not built (silent beats wrong).

## The discipline (lessons already paid for — read before building any of these)

1. **Build against ≥2 real repos that *contain the pattern*, from the start.**
   redux-thunk was tuned on **trezor-suite alone (n=1)**. The obvious second repo,
   **shapeshift/web**, fires **0** redux-thunk edges — and that 0 is *correct*:
   shapeshift has **zero** `createAsyncThunk`/`createThunk` (it's an **RTK Query**
   codebase, 14 `createApi` files). So shapeshift could neither confirm nor refute
   generalization — it doesn't contain the shape. **A synthesizer validated on one
   repo is unvalidated.** Pick the validation repos *by grepping for the pattern
   first*, not by reputation.

2. **"One framework" ≠ "one shape."** The trezor→shapeshift split is the proof:
   - `createAsyncThunk` + thunk→thunk `dispatch(Y())` chains → **redux-thunk** ✅ (trezor)
   - `createApi` + `builder.query/mutation` endpoints → hooks/components → **RTK Query** 🔬 (shapeshift) — a *different, unbuilt* synthesizer
   - plain `dispatch(action)` → matching `reducer`/slice `case` → **slice-dispatch** ⬜
   Don't let "we did Redux" hide two-thirds of Redux.

3. **Precision is free recall's price.** redux-thunk's 0-on-shapeshift is the *good*
   kind of zero (no false edges on a non-thunk repo — same bar as the playbook's
   "0 on every non-pattern control"). Every synthesizer below must show **0 on a
   control that lacks the shape** *and* **non-zero + precise on ≥2 that have it**.

4. **Two-part master lever still governs.** An edge only helps if a *realistic
   symbol-named explore seeds a path it lies on*. A synthesizer whose far endpoint
   no normal query names buys nothing (the trezor "11 explores" tail). Prefer shapes
   where both endpoints are names an agent would actually type.

5. **Partial coverage is worse than none** (playbook §7). Close each flow
   *end-to-end* and re-measure; never ship a half-bridged flow.

## The backlog (prioritized by frequency × static-resolvability × query-seedability)

### Tier A — high traffic, cleanly static, build next

| Shape | Ecosystem | The static anchor that bridges it | Mechanism | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Name→class registry / command bus** | any (TS/JS first) | object-literal registry `{key: Handler}` + computed-key dispatch `(new) reg[var](…)` | S (fan-out, `object-registry`) | ✅ **SHIPPED v1 (2026-06-20)** — `objectRegistryEdges`. Links each dispatcher fn → each registered handler's callable entry (a class's `execute`/run/handle method — preferring the method chained at the dispatch — or the function value). Precise on **xrengine** (CommandManager, 64 edges, class registry → `.execute`), **Prebid.js** (7: builder/consent/message dispatch, fn registry), **warp-drive** (1). **0 false positives** after: minified-file skip (avg line >200), **depth-aware** entry parse (top-level `key: Ident` only — method-shorthand/nested-object bodies don't leak), callable-only targets (no data `constant`), dynamic-dispatch gate. Handles constructor + field-initializer (`this.` normalized) forms. **Deferred (recall, documented):** assign-then-call (`const h=reg[k]; h()` — warp-drive's main `COMMANDS`), augmentation (`reg[k]=H` — Prebid single-entry), method-shorthand entry recall, and the **cross-file barrel-namespace** variant (trezor `getMethod`: `import * as M; M[method]→new` + computed dynamic import + camel↔Pascal — the hard tier, still 🔬). |
| **RTK Query** | TS / Redux Toolkit | `createApi({ endpoints: b => ({ getX: b.query(...) }) })` → generated `useGetXQuery` hook → component; endpoint name ↔ hook name (`getX`↔`useGetXQuery`) is convention | X (extract endpoints) + S (endpoint→hook) | ✅ **SHIPPED (2026-06-20)** — `synthesizedBy:'rtk-query'`. **X:** extraction mints a function node per endpoint (named by its key, spanning the `queryFn`/`query` handler so its calls attribute; both `endpoints: b => ({…})` arrow and `endpoints(b){ return {…} }` method forms; a factory-handler endpoint `queryFn: makeFn(url)` falls back to a bare node spanning the builder call) **and** per generated-hook binding from `export const {…} = api` (carrying the sentinel signature `= RTK Query generated hook`). **S:** `rtkQueryEdges` bridges hook→same-file endpoint by the naming convention (strip `use` + optional `Lazy` + `Query`/`Mutation`, lc head). Component→hook is normal import/call resolution; hook→endpoint surfaces in explore as `dynamic: rtk query`. Validated **100% precision** (hooks == synth edges, **0 cross-file**) on **basetool** (small, 54 edges, both forms + factory fallback), **minusx-metabase** (small, 11), **shapeshift** (large, 13); **0** on the uwave-web control (no `createApi` → a complete no-op, 0 nodes/edges added). Sentinel gate correctly ignores hand-written look-alikes (shapeshift's `useFoxyQuery` is a real custom hook, never bridged). **Deferred:** cross-module `injectEndpoints` where the hook destructuring's RHS isn't the same bare api const (synth requires same-file endpoint). |
| **Vuex / Pinia** | Vue | `store.dispatch('ns/action')` / `commit('mutation')` → action/mutation by string key (namespaced); Pinia `useStore().action()` instance call | **X (extract collections) ✅ + S (dispatch bridge) ⬜** | 🟡 **EXTRACTION FOUNDATION SHIPPED (2026-06-20)** — store actions/mutations/getters are now nodes (`codegraph_node login`/`getSessionList` works). Corpus probe found this is **NOT one clean string-keyed shape** — it's ~5: **(1)** Vuex MODULE non-exported `const actions/mutations = {…}` (element-admin), **(2)** Vuex split-file `export default {…}` + computed-key `commit(CONST)` + `mapActions` (vue2-elm), **(3)** Pinia OPTIONS `defineStore({actions:{…}})` (Geeker), **(4)** Pinia SETUP `defineStore('id',()=>{const f=…;return{f}})` body-locals (MallChat), **(5)** Pinia `useStore().action()` instance dispatch. Extraction covers **1, 3, 4** (`extractObjectLiteralFunctions` on `actions`/`mutations`/`getters` collections + a `findPiniaSetupFn`/`extractPiniaSetupBody` for setup locals; `looksLikeVueStoreFile` ≥2-signal gate + the shape gate make it a **0-node no-op on a Redux control** despite the word "actions"). Validated findable on element-admin (50 fns), Geeker (21), MallChat (68); vue2-elm form-2 + computed-key **deferred** (n=1, needs export-default dispatch + const-string resolution). **The dispatch BRIDGE synth, 2 members — BOTH ✅ SHIPPED (2026-06-20):** **(a)** Vuex string-key `dispatch('ns/action')`/`commit('M')` → action/mutation node — `synthesizedBy:'vuex-dispatch'` (`vuexDispatchEdges`): last `/` segment = action name, preceding = namespace; resolve to a function node IN A STORE FILE (the ≥2-signal `isStoreFile` gate excludes a same-named `api/` helper — `getInfo`/`login` collide), disambiguated by the immediate namespace segment in the path (handles DEEP nesting `d2admin/user/set`) or same-file for a root local `commit('M')`. Also added `export default { namespaced, actions:{…}, mutations:{…} }` extraction (the canonical Vuex module form — `extractStoreCollectionMethods` off the export_statement, store-file gated) since d2-admin needs it. **100% precision: element-admin 55 edges, vue-admin-template 12, d2-admin 63; 0 non-store targets, 0 namespace mismatches (54/54 namespaced edges route to the correct module); 0 on Redux controls (basetool/uwave — non-string `dispatch()` ignored).** `+ vuex-dispatch-synthesizer.test.ts`. **(b)** Pinia `useStore().action()` → action — ✅ **SHIPPED (2026-06-20)** `synthesizedBy:'pinia-store'` (`piniaStoreEdges`): maps each `const useXStore=defineStore(…)` factory → its file, binds `const s=useXStore()` per consumer file, links the enclosing fn (or the `.vue` component, via fallback) → the `s.method()` action node IN THE STORE'S FILE (same-store-file gate ⇒ `$patch`/built-ins/unrelated same-named methods resolve to nothing). Covers options + setup forms uniformly. **100% precision** (Geeker 41 edges, MallChat 64; 0 targets outside a store file), 0 on the Vuex-only element-admin control; surfaces as `dynamic: pinia store`; suite 1612 + `pinia-store-synthesizer.test.ts`. Corpus: `/tmp/cg-vuex-eval/{vue-element-admin,vue2-elm,Geeker-Admin,MallChatWeb}`. |
| **NgRx effects** | Angular | `createEffect(() => actions.pipe(ofType(LoginAction), …))` → effect handler; `Store.dispatch(new LoginAction())` → effect by action type/class | S (type/class-keyed) | ⬜ |

### Tier B — backend command/event/message buses (each needs its own canonical flow + ≥2 repos)

| Shape | Ecosystem | Anchor | Mechanism | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **MediatR / CQRS** | .NET | `IRequest<T>` → `IRequestHandler<TReq,T>` by the generic request type; `_mediator.Send(new GetFooQuery())` → handler | S (generic-type-keyed) | 🔬 named a frontier in CLAUDE.md, but it's statically keyable via the generic — worth a real attempt |
| **Celery** | Python | `@shared_task`/`@app.task`/`@<app>.task`/`@task` def + `.delay()`/`.apply_async()` call → task body | S (decorator-gated name) | ✅ **SHIPPED (2026-06-20)** — `synthesizedBy:'celery-dispatch'` (`celeryDispatchEdges`). Link the enclosing fn at each `.delay(`/`.apply_async(` site → the task fn. Precision rests on the DECORATOR gate: the dispatched name must resolve to a Python `function` carrying a task decorator, read from the source lines ABOVE its `def` (the def's own startLine excludes the decorator; no `decorates` edge exists — `@shared_task` is an unresolved external import). `kind==='function'` filter drops the same-named test-method collision (`consume_file`). Canvas forms (`group(t).delay()`, `t.s()`/`.si()`) have no single identifier before `.delay` → skipped, not mis-bridged. Cross-module name collision → same-file preference else bail. **100% precision: paperless-ngx (small, `@shared_task`, 31 edges, 31/31 real), pretix (medium, `@app.task`, 63 edges across 21 tasks, 0/21 FP); 0 on the httpie control (no Celery).** Node-stable (pure edge synth, no extraction change). Surfaces as `dynamic: celery dispatch @site` via the generic fallback. `+ celery-dispatch-synthesizer.test.ts`. **Deferred (recall):** canvas dispatch, class-based `Task` subclasses, `app.send_task('dotted.name')` string dispatch, aliased imports (`import send_email as s; s.delay()`). |
| **Sidekiq** | Ruby | `class W; include Sidekiq::Job; def perform; end` + `W.perform_async(...)` → `perform` | S (class→perform) | ⬜ — the Ruby sibling of Celery; build next-to-it (grep-confirm ≥2 `perform_async` repos). |
| **Laravel / Spring events** | PHP / Java | `event(OrderShipped::class)` → `EventServiceProvider` listener map; `@EventListener onX(EventT)` → publisher by event type | R (mapped) | ⬜ |

### Tier C — frontier, ⛔ do **not** build (no static anchor; would add noise)

| Shape | Why not | 
|---|---|
| **RxJS subscribe** | observable→observer is predominantly *anonymous* closures; no name to seed (playbook ⬜, deferred) |
| **MobX / Vue-reactivity / Solid signals** | Proxy reactive runtime — the edge doesn't exist statically at all; silent beats wrong (matches vue-core deferral) |
| **Redux-Saga** | generator `yield put()` / `takeEvery(ACTION, saga*)` — generator-body dispatch, materially harder; revisit only if a real repo demands it |

### Already shipped (for context)

| Shape | `synthesizedBy` | Validated on |
|---|---|---|
| Redux thunk | `redux-thunk` | ✅ **generalizes (2026-06-20)** — precise on uwave-web (small, 5 edges), session-desktop (medium, 2), trezor (large, 211); control shapeshift (RTK Query, no thunks) = 0. Receiver-agnostic (`api.dispatch`/`thunkApi.dispatch`/`window.…dispatch` all matched). **⚠️ 2 follow-ups below.** |
| Object-literal registry | `object-registry` | ✅ **shipped (2026-06-20)** — xrengine `CommandManager` (64), Prebid.js (7), warp-drive (1); 0 false positives after 4 precision gates. |
| RTK Query | `rtk-query` | ✅ **shipped (2026-06-20)** — 100% precision (hooks == synth edges, 0 cross-file) on basetool (54), minusx-metabase (11), shapeshift (13); 0 on uwave-web control. Extraction mints endpoint + generated-hook nodes; synth bridges hook→endpoint by convention. |
| Pinia store | `pinia-store` | ✅ **shipped (2026-06-20)** — `useStore().action()` instance dispatch → action; 100% precision Geeker (41) / MallChat (64), 0 on element-admin (Vuex) control. |
| Vuex dispatch | `vuex-dispatch` | ✅ **shipped (2026-06-20)** — string `dispatch('ns/action')`/`commit('M')` → handler; 100% precision element-admin (55) / vue-admin-template (12) / d2-admin (63), 0 on Redux controls. |
| Celery | `celery-dispatch` | ✅ **shipped (2026-06-20)** — `.delay()`/`.apply_async()` → `@shared_task`/`@app.task` body; 100% precision paperless-ngx (31) / pretix (63 across 21 tasks), 0 on httpie control. Decorator-gated via source above the `def`. |
| (see playbook §6 / `callback-synthesizer.ts` for the other ~20 channels) | | |

### redux-thunk follow-ups (found by the n>1 validation — this is exactly what it's for)

1. **Precision: name-collision target resolution — ✅ FIXED (2026-06-20).** `reduxThunkEdges`
   resolved the dispatched name via `getNodesByName(name).find(kind ∈ {constant,function,
   method})` — first match wins, no preference for the thunk. On **octo-call**, `leaveCall`
   collides (a `createAsyncThunk` const at `state/call.ts:201` *and* a service `function`
   at `services/firestore-signaling.ts:253`); **both** edges mis-resolved to the *service
   function*. trezor's long unique thunk names hid this. **Fix:** resolution now prefers a
   thunk-signature const > other const > same-file callable > first match (single-candidate
   unaffected). Verified: octo-call's 2 edges now target the thunk (`call.ts:201`); uwave's 5
   unchanged; regression test in `__tests__/redux-thunk-synthesizer.test.ts`.
2. **Surfacing: synth edges between non-callable nodes were invisible — ✅ ROOT-CAUSED + FIXED
   (2026-06-20).** redux-thunk connects `constant` nodes (thunks are `const X=createAsyncThunk`),
   but explore's flow machinery assumed callables, so the hop fell through both surfacing
   paths: **(a)** `buildFlowFromNamedSymbols` filtered its named set to
   `CALLABLE={method,function,component,constructor}` (tools.ts:1554) → constants never entered
   the Flow scan / #687 Dynamic-dispatch-links loop, at any tier; **(b)** the kind-agnostic
   `### Relationships` section (which *does* render constant→constant) is
   `includeRelationships:false` below 500 files. Net: redux-thunk edges surfaced ONLY via
   Relationships, ONLY on repos ≥500 files (uwave/octo-call showed nothing). **Fix (surgical,
   tier-independent):** a `dynNamed` set of named CONSTANT/VARIABLE/FIELD nodes that participate
   in a heuristic edge feeds the `## Dynamic-dispatch links` scan (main call-chain stays
   callable-only); plus a generic `synthEdgeNote` fallback so any synth hop reads
   `dynamic: <kind> @wiring-site`, not a bare `[calls]`. Verified: uwave `shufflePlaylist→
   loadPlaylist` and `register→login→initState` now surface; trezor unchanged; full suite +
   new `__tests__/explore-synth-constant-endpoints.test.ts` pass. **No-op for callable flows**
   (dynNamed stays empty) — so it generalizes: any future constant/variable/field-connecting
   synth (RTK Query, Vuex) surfaces for free.

## Per-synthesizer validation protocol (condensed from the playbook)

For each shape, before marking ✅:
1. **Grep ≥3 real repos for the pattern**; keep the **2+ that contain it** (small/medium)
   + **1 control that lacks it**. (Graph-level precision/recall validation does **not**
   need not-trained-on repos — that constraint is only for *agent A/B baselines*.)
2. **Measure the hole**: `select count(*) from edges where synthesizedBy='X'` →
   non-zero + node count stable (no explosion) on the pattern repos; **0 on the control**.
3. **Precision spot-check**: sample ~12 edges; source & target must both be real and the
   indirection must actually exist in the source body.
4. **Seed a flow**: `scripts/agent-eval/probe-explore.mjs` with the shape's endpoint
   symbol names → the Flow section shows the path through the synthesized hop.
5. **Agent A/B** (only for the headline repo, not every control): `--model sonnet
   --effort high`, n≥2/arm, record Read/Grep/duration.

## Immediate next actions

- [ ] **Validate redux-thunk for real (workstream 1):** clone a small + medium
      `createAsyncThunk`-using app (grep-confirmed), re-index, repeat the protocol.
      Promote `redux-thunk` 🟡→✅ or fix the overfit. *(None of the 4 already-cloned
      eval repos contain `createAsyncThunk`.)*
- [ ] **Decide trezor end (workstream 3):** the **name→class registry** synthesizer is
      the valuable, generalizable Tier-A item (closes trezor's `getMethod` end *and*
      n8n/VS-Code-class registries). The **facade** (`connect-common/factory.ts`) is
      **low-value** — it collapses every method to a single `call` fan-in with no
      per-method disambiguation; bridging it buys ~nothing. Build the registry, skip the facade.
- [x] **RTK Query (workstream 2 spillover):** ✅ **shipped (2026-06-20)** —
      `synthesizedBy:'rtk-query'`, validated on basetool / minusx-metabase /
      shapeshift (+ uwave control). See the Tier-A row for the mechanism.
      **Next RTK spillover:** the cross-module `injectEndpoints` case (hooks
      destructured off an enhanced api in a different file than the base) — the
      synth's same-file gate skips it today; would need a same-`reducerPath` or
      import-following relaxation, validated on a repo that splits endpoints.
